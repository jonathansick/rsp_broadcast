Due to some urgently required electrical maintenance work in the SRCF data center that houses the S3DF system we are required to take an outage of the entire system from July 10-12, 2024. We apologize for the inconvenience and the shorter than usual notice. This three day outage will begin at 8AM PDT on July 10, 2024 and run through 8PM PDT on July 12, 2024. All S3DF systems will be unavailable during this period - login nodes, batch system, Kubernetes nodes, storage systems and networking.
We will post regular updates on this outage as we get closer to the outage date on the S3DF webpage (https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/public/doc/#/changelog).
