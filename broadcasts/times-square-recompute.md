You can now recompute a cached [Times Square](/times-square) page.

To recompute a Times Square page, click the "Recompute" button in the left side bar. You will get live updates on the progress of the recomputation.

This feature is for notebooks that aren't "idempotent" (for example, new data is available for a given set of input parameters). If you change the notebook code itself in your GitHub repository you should find that cached notebooks are automatically.

If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know in [#dm-square](https://lsstc.slack.com/archives/C2JP8GGVC) on Slack.
