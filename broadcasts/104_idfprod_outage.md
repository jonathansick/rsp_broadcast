We are performing a major schema migration is planned on the Butler databases containing DP0.2 data. 
To say it's taking longer than anticipated would be an understatement.

Butler and VO image service access to DP0.2 data will be unavailable and/or read-only during this time.

This message will disappear when the migration is complete.
