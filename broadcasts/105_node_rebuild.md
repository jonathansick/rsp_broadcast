This week's Patch Thursday includes cluster upgrades and major software upgrades. This will terminate all running Notebook sessions and will make services inaccessible while the cluster is being rebuilt. If you can get to it, you may use it - but save early and often and don't start any long executions. The node upgrades take some time so expect transient issues for a few hours after the normal Patch Thursday window.
