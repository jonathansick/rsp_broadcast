summary: DP0.3 (solar system object) queries UNAVAILABLE Wednesday-Sunday
env:
  - idfprod
enabled: true

Due to some urgently required electrical maintenance work at SLAC, the databases holding DP0.3 catalogs will be off-line all the way to (and possibly into) the weekend (July 10-13th)
We are sorry for this disruption.

DP0.2 data is currently hosted on cloud and will remain available.

For those interested in more details:

The Rubin Science Platform at data.lsst.cloud is deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
However due to programmatic reasons, the data is stored on-premises at the S3DF facility at SLAC.
This combination of services on cloud with data holdings on-prem is referred to as the hybrid US Data Access Center (US-DAC).
When there is an outage on the on-premises facility, capabilities at data.lsst.cloud will be severely degraded.

What you can do at data.lsst.cloud when data is unavailable:

* Use Notebooks (as long as they don't access unavailable data)
* Use the Portal to query archives other than Rubin
* Manage your account settings
