So you can use functions like now() in your InfluxQL queries safely, and manipulate time using Flux without worring about the time shift between TAI and UTC. The column private_sndStamp still has the timestamp values in TAI in case you need to work with them. This change affects telemetry recorded after 2021-10-13 21:46:57 UTC at the Summit EFD.",
